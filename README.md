# WhatsApp web dark theme

## Neat dark theme for WhatsApp web

In order to install this theme you need to install _Stylish_:

- [Install Stylish for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylish-custom-themes-for/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe?hl=en)

- [Install Stylish for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/nl/firefox/addon/stylish/)

[Direct link to install the skin](https://userstyles.org/styles/182006/dark-minimal-whatsapp-june-20-vpx)

As it's not allowed to publish the skin including external urls for safety reasons on the platform, I created a version (skin-whtsapp.css)that can bypass this problem and allows to import external fonts. I set Raleway as a font.
To install the skin and include the Raleway font simply edit the installed skin by clicking on the Stylish extension icon --> menu --> edit styles and uncomment the import line

You can take a look at the previews in the screenshots folder.

Enjoy!
